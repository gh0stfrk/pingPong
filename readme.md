## Configuration ⚙️
- There are two parts to this setup. The first part covers AWS configuration, and the second part focuses on setting up the GitHub repository and GitHub Actions.
- I wrote a blog post that details the steps to set up both parts. Give it a read, and feel free to ask questions if you get stuck. I'll respond to as many as possible.
